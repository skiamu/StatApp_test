# Slide 3 (raw dataset): [victor ?] add dimension of the tables
# Slide 4 (links): OK
# Slide 5 (Indicators): OK 
# Slide 6 (Indicators as 3d matrix): [diana ?] show table with countries as rows and indicators as col (via 'dcast' or by hand),
#                                              show 3 layer 'like a pile seen from above',
#                                              indicate somehow the years (with arrows ?)
#                                              other ideas are welcome
# Silde 7 (Problems): [Leo]

# Silde 9 (Problems, small country): [Leo] plot0002
# Silde 10 (Problems, too many indicators): [Leo] plot0003
# Silde 11 (): [Leo] Our approach 1 goal
# Silde 12 (): [Leo] Our approach 2 fix year (2010)
# Silde 13 (): [Leo] Our approach 3 shrink countries with too many missing values
# Silde 14 (): [Leo] Our approach 4 order the indicator by 'fullness'
# Silde 15 (): [Leo] Our approach 5 select manually the ind
# --- from now on only if in the presentation we will have time
# Silde 16 (): [Leo] Our approach 6 evaluate fullness
# Silde 17 (): [Leo] Our approach 7 consider remaining anomalies
# Silde 18 (): [Leo] Our approach 8 missing values
# Silde 19 (): [Leo] Our approach 9 expand over years
# Silde 20 (): [Leo] further studies

ToDo: 
     1) find thresholds for states, same analysis for indicators
     2) look for indicators with sum constraints
     3) pca with % and abs values, how to behave?
     4) which data should be gaussian?
