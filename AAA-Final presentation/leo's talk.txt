LEO's speech (draft)

#### start
{Slide 1 DATASET}
Let's start from our dataset:
we found the dataset on Kaggle and it contains observation of several economic indicators, 
such as c02 emission, mortality rate, GDP and others, 
for all the countries in the world and from 1960 to 2015.

The dataset contains a lot of information but it is very irregular and this constrained our analysis.

{Slide 2 Flow DATASET-GOAL.1}
Now our goal is to 'find the country that will develop more' but this is too general,
Moreover the information we have is related to topics that are extremely different between each other

{Slide 3 Flow DATASET-GOAL.2}
To reach our goal we extracted and processed from the dataset the most interesting information,
so that we could give to a possible investor an user-friendly tool 
that could help him in choosing where to invest

{Slide 4 Shiny}
To build this tool we used 'Shiny'
that is a 'web application framework for R'
within this framework we can build an interactive interface 
that show the output of our R code in a dynamic way

{Shiny 1: open App}
In this application the user select the country he want to know something about:
for instance we select: [CNT]
{Shiny 2: select from [CNT_DEAULT] to [CNT]}

In the first tab we have a summary on all the topics, 
with a quick description of the interesting features of each topic
for instance, for what concerne [TOPIC], [CNT] is [DESCRIPTION]

Now let's expand the analysis for [TOPIC]:
{Shiny 3: go to the [TOPIC] tab} 
we can see that the countries in the world are divided in [NCLU] groups
each one with its own quick description that matches the one observed before,
infact [CNT] is in [NCLU_CNT]
from this map we can have a quick overall view on how the things are going for this topic,
and maybe consider to move our analysis on another country

{Shiny 4: scroll down to radarchart}
we can then have a look at the radarchart that explain how the description of each cluster is made,
{Shiny 4: tick check box radarchart}
in addition we can add to this chart the features of the country we are analyzing 
so that we can understand if its features are similar to the mean ones of its cluster
or it has some peculiarities
{Shiny 5: scroll down to similar countries}
then we can also have a look at the countries that are similar w.r.t. to this topic
along with their respective groups
{Shiny 6: increase the number of similare countries}
for instance [CNT] that is in cluster [NCLU_CNT] is similar to countries in cluster [?] and [?1]
meaning that its description should be slightly modified

{Shiny 7: scroll down the change features area}
then we asked ourselves:
if the values change, would [CNT] be in another cluster?
first you will be able to select an year and the corresponding values will be displayed,
{Shiny 8: change year [YEAR DEFAULT] to [YEAR]}
so you can get an idea for reasonable values.
then you will have to set the values changed according to your view.
after that it will be shown the corresponding cluster.
{Shiny 9: do nothing, too time depending}
however this will be showned later 

this analysis was performed for 7 topics
{Shiny 10: go to tab [TOPIC2]}

In addition to this 7 there is an indicator that is more relevant than the other: the GDP growth
{Shiny 11: go to tab [GDP growth]}
we have a plot of the 10years growth
we decided to use it because it is more stable w.r.t. jumps and our data end close to the 2008
it can be shown also the predicted values for some upcoming years
{Shiny 12: tick checkbox prediction}

one can compare the 10years growth of the country with another one
or have a look at it by itslef
{Shiny 13: tick checkbox hide}

but now let's see what's behind this tool 
{GO TO PRESENTATION}
