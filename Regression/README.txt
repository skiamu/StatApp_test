how to use this mess?
The analysis is divided in 2 parts:
1) Explanatory Model for the 10-year Growth
2) Prediction of the 10-year Growth.
(+ 3) plots)

1) for running this part just run step-by-step files "exp1_script.R" and "exp2_script.R".
   They are the same analysis in two different time periods, it could be interesting to highlight the differences.
   
2) for running the second part (and get the data for the app) just run the file "pred_run.R" after havingset the correct folder path.
3) "exp_plot.R" still work-in-progress, it should indipendent from the others and could be run separately (hopefully)
